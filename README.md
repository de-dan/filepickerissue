This repository shows an issue with the current version of [@capawesome/capacitor-file-picker](https://capawesome.io/plugins/file-picker/).

1. Run this capacitor app on an android device
2. Pick a big file (I wasn't able to narrow it down) I used sample_1920x1080.mov from https://filesamples.com/formats/mov
3. Expected result: FilePicker retrieves data and displays information on screen
4. Current result: No event, no error, no feedback from the plugin
